# This is the default vitam strategy ('default'). It is mandatory and must define a referent offer.
# This list of offers will be ordered by the property rank. It has to be completed if more offers are necessary
# The property rank indicates the rank of the offer in the strategy. The ranking is done is ASC order and should be different for all declared offers

# Optional params for each offers in vitam_strategy. If not set, the default values are applied.
#    referent: false              # true / false (default), only one per site must be referent
#    status: ACTIVE               # ACTIVE (default) / INACTIVE
#    vitam_site_name: distant-dc2 # default is the value of vitam_site_name defined in your local inventory file, should be specified with the vitam_site_name defined for the distant offer
#    distant: false               # true / false (default). If set to true, it will not check if the provider for this offer is correctly set
#    id: idoffre                  # OPTIONAL, but IF ACTIVATED, MUST BE UNIQUE & SAME if on another site
#    asyncRead: false             # true / false (default). Should be set to true for tape offer only
#    rank: 0                      # Integer that indicates in ascending order the priority of the offer in the strategy

# Example for tape offer:
# Tape offer mustn't be referent (referent: false) and should be configured as asynchrone read (asyncRead: true)
#  - name: offer-tape-1
#    referent: false
#    asyncRead: true
#    rank: 0

# Example distant offer:
#  - name: distant
#    referent: false
#    vitam_site_name: distant-dc2
#    distant: true # Only add this parameter when distant offer (not on same platform)
#    rank: 1

# WARNING : multi-strategy is a BETA functionality
# More strategies can be added but are optional
# Strategy name must only use [a-z][a-z0-9-]* pattern
# Any strategy must contain at least one offer
# This list of offers is ordered. It can and has to be completed if more offers are necessary
# Every strategy can define at most one referent offer.
