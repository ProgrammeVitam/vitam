    # Bucket configuration
    # ====================
    # Bucket allows physical separation of data written to the tapes by tenant(s).
    # Data of tenants of the same bucket can be written on the same tape.
    # Data of tenants of different buckets cannot be written to the same tape.
    #
    # "name": the name of the bucket
    #    Should be unique
    #    Can only contain alphanumerical only characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
    #    Do not use "backup" as a bucket name (reserved internally for DB backup)
    # "tenants": The list of tenants of the bucket.
    #    Every bucket contins 1 or multiple tenants.
    #    Every tenant should belong to exactly 1 bucket (no duplicates, no missing tenants)
    #    The affectation of a tenant to a bucket is definitive and CANNOT be changed later
    #    When adding new tenants to Vitam, they can be added to an existing bucket OR to a new bucket
    # "tarBufferingTimeoutInMinutes":
    #    Max buffering delay before a TAR archive is sealed and scheduled for archival on tape.
    #    A TAR archive is sealed once it reaches a critical size ("maxTarFileSize") OR buffering delay expired, whatever occurs first
