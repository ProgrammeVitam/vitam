 *
 * This implementation enable authentication by header if no certificate found in the request attribute
 * and the useHeader parameter is true
 * The checked header is "X-SSL-CLIENT-CERT" and the value must be a valid public certificate as pem formatted string
 *
 * To enable this filter, replace in shiro.ini the key x509 to be equal to the current filter as follow.
 * x509 = fr.gouv.vitam.common.auth.web.filter.X509AuthenticationFilter
 *
 * To enable use if header check in shiro.ini add the following
 * x509.useHeader = true
 * Be careful, passing a header certificate is not fully secure (Possible injection during the routing).
 *
 * We recommend the use of request attribute instead of header.
